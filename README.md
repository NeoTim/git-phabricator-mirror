# Git/Phabricator Mirror

This repo contains code that automatically mirrors source code metadata between
git-notes and Phabricator.

## Setup

This tool expects to run in an environment with the following attributes:

1.  The "arcanist" command line tool is installed and included in the PATH.
2.  A ".arcrc" file is located where arcanist will find it, specifies a URL for
    a Phabricator instance which should be used for any repos that do not
    override the default instance, and provides auth credentials for every
    Phabricator instance that is used.
3.  The current working directory contains a clone of every git repo that needs
    to be mirrored.
4.  The git command line tool is installed, and included in the PATH.
5.  The git command line tool is configured with the credentials it needs to
    push to the remotes for all of those repos.
6.  The "mysql" command line tool is installed, and has been preconfigured with
    the IP address, username, and password necessary to connect to the
    Phabricator database. This is a (hopefully temporary) workaround to the
    fact that the Phabricator API does not yet support querying revision
    transactions.

## Metadata

The source code metadata is stored in git-notes, using the formats described
below. Each item stored is written as a single line of JSON, and is written
with at most one such item per line. This allows the git notes to be
automatically merged using the "cat\_sort\_uniq" strategy.

Since these notes are not in a human-friendly form, all of the refs used to
track them will start with the prefix "refs/notes/devtools". This helps make
it clear that these are meant to be read and written by automated tools.

### Code Review Requests

Code review requests correspond to Differential diffs. They are stored in the
"refs/notes/devtools/reviews" ref, and annotate the first revision in a review.
They must conform to the following schema.

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "reviewRef": {
          "id": "reviewRef",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "targetRef": {
          "id": "targetRef",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "reviewers": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        "description": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "v": {
          "type": "integer",
          "default": 0,
          "enum": [
            null,
            0
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "targetRef"
      ]
    }

The "reviewRef" field is used to specify a git ref that tracks the current
revision under review, and the "targetRef" field is used to specify the git ref
that should be updated once the review is approved.

The timestamp field represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. The
v field represents the version of the metadata format. If omitted, that means
the version is 0.

### Build and Test Status

The build and test statuses of a commit is written to the ref
"refs/notes/devtools/ci", and annotates the commit that was actually built and
tested. They must conform to the following schema.

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "url": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "status": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": [
            null,
            "success",
            "failure"
          ]
        },
        "agent": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "v": {
          "type": "integer",
          "default": 0,
          "enum": [
            null,
            0
          ]
        }
      },
    }

### Robot Comments

Robot comments are comments generated by static analysis tools. They correspond
to ShipShape results or Differential inline comments.

These are stored in the "refs/notes/devtools/analyses" ref, and annotate the
revision. They must conform to the following schema, which is taken from the
Note protocol buffer message defined
[here](https://github.com/google/shipshape/blob/master/shipshape/proto/note.proto).

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "path": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "range": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "startLine": {
                  "type": "integer"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "category": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "description": {
          "id": "description",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "description"
      ]
    }

### Review Comments

Review comments are comments that were written by a person rather than by a
machine. They correspond to Differential comments with an action of "comment"
(when commenting on an entire revision) or Differential inline comments (when
commenting on a specific line).

These are stored in the "refs/notes/devtools/discuss" ref, and annotate the
first revision in the review. They must conform to the following schema, which
is loosely based on the note schema above.

    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "author": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "parent": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "location": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "commit": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "path": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "range": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "startLine": {
                  "type": "integer"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "description": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "resolved": {
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        "v": {
          "type": "integer",
          "default": 0,
          "enum": [
            null,
            0
          ]
        }
      }
    }

When the parent is specified, it must be the SHA1 hash of another comment on
the same revision, and it means this comment is a reply to that comment.

The timestamp field represents the number of seconds since the Unix epoch, and
is formatted as a 10 digit decimal number with zero padding. It should be the
first field written, so that the lexicographical ordering of comments matches
their chronological ordering.

The v field represents the version of the metadata format. If omitted, that
means the version is 0.
